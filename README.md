# Ninju

Experimental VST3 audio procesor, mainly to rescue old records and teach
myself, C++/audio processing along the way.

Refer to JUCE Documentation for Linux dependencies, I only develop on
Fedora Linux 42. So sorry no instructions for Windows/Mac OS X.

## Build

```sh
make -C Builds/LinuxMakefile
```

## Run

```sh
./Builds/LinuxMakefile/build/ninju
```
